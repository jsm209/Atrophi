# Design Document
This is a simple todolist app to help me learn Vue 2, as well as help me
prioritize my life for the next year. 

## My needs and key problems with how I organize myself
1. I have a lot to do and it's hard to keep track of what order and
when to do things.
2. It bothers me when I physically see a list of things that are not
crossed off or done (out of sight out of mind mentality).
3. I want an easy to use, prioritized, single column, master list of tasks
that tells me the order to start my tasks.
4. I am constantly starting new lists because I have trouble maintaining my
current lists.
5. I want to write things I need to do down, even if it's really tiny so
that I can get to it at some point.

## MVP Requirements
- Single column list that auto priortizes itself.
- List self regulates itself, or otherwise makes it easier for me to regulate
it (i.e. toss junk or expired tasks off the list)


## Luxury Requirements
- Visibility options or optimization (only seeing x amount of tasks, or 
options for filtering)
- Task categories
- Timetable/schedule generator

## Systems/Features

### Tasks properties
The things I want to know about a task are:
- name
- description/notes
- score
- completion status



### Task Decay
Tasks should decay over time if I didn't do it today such that eventually
they will completely disappear if I never feel an urge to do it. I should
also be able to mark tasks as 'important' so they won't decay.
